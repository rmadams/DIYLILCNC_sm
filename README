This set of sheets is a modification of the DIYLILCNC project that
will allow it to be cut on a 12x24" lasercutter.  This required that
the layout of the sheets be modified, as well as several of the long
parts be changed by breaking them into parts, with staggered butted
"t-joints" which should provide enough structural strength to be
useful.

This design is curently unproved, and will remain so until the test
machine can be completed and the revised design verified.
Additionally, the layout of the sheets should be optimized to remove
unnecessary cuts, and minimize material use.
